# Issue-Tracker
An issue tracker app in which users can add issues for a project and ultimately track their overall progress, whilst being able to communicate with project collaborators. It is similar to applications such as Jira and the GitHub Issues system.

Motivation: Wanted to build a portfolio project that strengthened my knowledge of my current skills and try out technologies that were a bit larger than what i already knew.

Why did you build this project: In addition, I wanted to build something thatâ€™s useful to me when working and to code something that follows industry practices and is extensible.

What problem does it solve: I wanted to create an issue tracker that had the simplicity of something like GitHub Issues, but offers in-app tools that better facilitate team member communication.
